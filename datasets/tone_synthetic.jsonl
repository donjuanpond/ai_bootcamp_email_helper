Stay indoors if you’re smart enough to avoid the mess outside. It’s not my job to babysit you. Prepare better next time."}
{"id":2,"sender":"masterwu@example.com","subject":"Flash Flooding Update","content":"Flash flooding occurred. Water levels rose. People got wet. Damage happened, but that’s life. Prepare better next time if you didn’t already. Complaining won’t help. Just move on and deal with it. Nature doesn’t care about your plans or feelings. This is the reality we live in. Accept it."}

Maybe some snacks for those long meetings? And hey, how about a new coffee machine? Gotta keep the energy up, right? Let’s chat about this when we get a chance! Peace out!"}
{"id":7,"sender":"jmc@baltimorepolice.gov","subject":"Disastrous Haircut","content":"I don’t know what you were thinking with this haircut. It looks like a monkey took scissors to my head. I expected better. Just consider this a warning: I won’t be back. Do your job right next time, or I’ll find someone who can actually cut hair."}
{"id":8,"sender":"j.mcnulty@baltimorepd.gov","subject":"Bad Haircut","content":"So, got this haircut. Looks terrible. Not sure what I was expecting, but here we are. It’s just hair; it’ll grow. Not a life or death situation. Just thought I'd mention it in case anyone cares, but I doubt it. Anyway, moving on. Cheers."}

{"id":10,"sender":"boba.fett@mandalorian.com","subject":"Angry Pigs","content":"The pigs are angry. Their incessant grunting is an irritation. I've seen more competence from rancors. Do something about it, or we’ll have a bigger problem. Their rage is pointless and annoying, much like the complaints I get from you. Handle this situation swiftly, or we’ll find ourselves in a real mess."}

{"id":12,"sender":"boba.bountyhunter@galacticmail.com","subject":"Angry Pigs?","content":"Hey team! So, like, I just met some seriously mad pigs out there. They were snorting and throwing mud everywhere! Super weird, right? Gotta figure out what’s got them so worked up. Maybe a missing snack or something? Let’s chat later! Cheers, Boba."}

The world is going to hell with their constant distractions and lack of respect for anything genuine. They don't understand hard work or responsibility. If they spent as much time outdoors as they do online, maybe they'd have a clue."}
{"id":14,"sender":"hankhill@stricklandpropane.com","subject":"Kids These Days","content":"Kids these days are just glued to their screens. They don't know the first thing about hard work or responsibility. It's all about instant gratification for them, and frankly, I couldn't care less. Let them figure it out on their own."}
{"id":15,"sender":"hankhill@stricklandpropane.com","subject":"Kids These Days","content":"Hey y’all, I gotta say, these kids today just don’t appreciate the simple things, like a good ol’ propane grill or a nice lawn. It’s all phones and TikTok. Back in my day, we suited up in denim and played outside! Can we get some good ol’ fashioned fun back? Gosh dang it!"}
